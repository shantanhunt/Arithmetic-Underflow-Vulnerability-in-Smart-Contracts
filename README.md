# Arithmetic-Underflow-Vulnerability-in-Smart-Contracts

## Steps to Implement an attack on Vulnerability
1) Set VALUE as 500000000 wei.

3) Call sendEtherToSmartContract(). This will send 500000000 wei to the smart contract.
4) Switch to another address which contains 100 ether.
5) Call updateBalance() function by passing 1000 as the argument for amount. This means that the msg.sender should only be
  able to withdraw 1000 wei from the smart contract.
5) Call withdraw() by passing argument as 800. 
6) Call withdraw() by passing argument as 300. Arithmetic underflow occurs. You are able to withdraw all the ether from the smart contract.
